# Tableau Visualization of Toronto Crime 2022
## Introduction
We examined publicly accessible data from the Toronto Police to assess the safety and crime rates in the city. Analyzing trends and narratives, we gained insights into the overall situation regarding crime in Toronto

## Background
Top of mind, the following are the questions we want to answer
1. What type of crime is prevalent?
2. Where are the crimes happening?
3. When are the crimes occuring?
4. Any crime with increasing or decreasing trend?

## Tools Used
The analysis mainly made use of Tableau to develop visualization of the data

## Learnings
1. Use color not just for aesthetic purposes but also to highight findings and group ideas together
2. Simple charts can convey deep insights if used properly
3. How to use dashboards and datastory in Tableau
4. Choose charts depending on the data you want to show

## Conclusion
### Insight
   In Toronto, there's a rise in crime rates, especially in Assault, Auto-theft, and Break and Enter categories. It's crucial to stay vigilant, especially in identified neighborhoods, both during the evenings and midday. Car theft is also on the rise, so it's essential for car owners to be prepared and ensure the safety of their belongings.

### Closing
    The project provided me with the opportunity to acquire proficiency in utilizing Tableau for communicating insights derived from data in a concise and structured fashion. By grasping the principles of effective visualization and graph creation, I am able to articulate discoveries in a manner that is accessible and comprehensible, even to individuals without technical backgrounds.
